Project: Cancer extraction from MRI images using MATLAB

One aspect of this field is the processing of MRI images. The challenge of identifying tumors is becoming more prevalent as the number of people affected by them rises. A number of variables, including pollution and behaviors, are contributing to this development. Finding a tumor has never been easy since it takes a lot of effort and extensive knowledge of human anatomy. This study outlines the suggested method for identifying and removing brain tumors from patients. With MATLAB software, tumors can be found and extracted from brain MRI scan images.
Mathematical morphology is a systematic way to analyzing the geometric properties of signals or images, and ithas been widely used in applications including edge recognition, object segmentation, and noise suppression
